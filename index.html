        <h1>What is Robotics?</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Robotics and Automation is the science of building and operating robots
               to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence and effort.
              This field combines multiple disciplines including engineering, computer science,
               and artificial intelligence to create machines capable of performing a variety of tasks.
              Robotics goes beyond humanoid robots to include a wide range of automated systems and devices.</p>

        <h1>A bit of History</h1>
        <div>
            
            <p>The dream to create machines that are skilled and intelligent has 
                been part of humanity from the beginning of time. The dream is now 
                becoming part of our world's striking reality. The legend of the 
                Titan Prometheus who moulded the giant Talus , the bronze slave  
                forged by Hephaestus, testify to this quest in Greek mythology. 
                Just as giant Talus was entrusted to protect the island of Crete
                 the industrial age, a mechanical creature is entrusted with
                the task of substituting a human being in labor duties. This 
                concept was introduced by the Czech playwright Karel Capek in 
                1921 in his play Rassum’s Universal Robots. Where he coined 
                the word robot from robota which means forced laborer. 
                While the concept was born in friction, the practical 
                definition of robots varies whereby according to Karel Capek, a 
                robot was a machine similar to a human being, according to the 
                Oxford English dictionary, it is a machine capable of carrying out 
                a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable 
                by computer . Also the International Organisation of standardisation
                 describes it as an automatically controlled programmable in 3 or more 
                 axes either fixed or mobile for use in industrial automation. In addition, 
                 the robot institute of america defines it as reprogrammable multifunctional 
                 manipulator designed to move materials, tools, and specialized devices through 
                 variable programmable motions for performance of a variety of tasks

        <h1>Applications Of Robotics and Automation</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>   
                <li>Automation and Robotics in construction - 
                Building and construction is one of the major  industries  
                around the world. Applications and the activities of robotics
                 and automation in this industry started in the early 90s 
                 aiming to optimize equipment operations, improve safety, 
                 enhance perception of workspace  and ensure a quality
                  environment for building occupants.</li>

                <li>Agricultural industries- Automation and robotics are applied 
                in the various stages of the agriculture industries like 
                irrigation of horticulture land, parks, gardens and golf 
                courses efficiently and reducing  the wastage  of water . 
                Food safety by the selection of appropriate chemicals. 
                Smart farming also helps to maintain the humidity, 
                temperature and irrigation process by using the sensors 
                and apps.</li>

                <li>Quantitative risk assessment in financial institutions- 
                The integration of robotic process automation in quantitative
                 risk assessment signifies a substantial advancement  in  
                 financial  risk management . Traditional approaches  
                 frequently had difficulty in handling the vast volume and 
                 complexibility  of financial data which can lead to 
                 inefficiencies  and potential  inaccuracies in risk
                  assessment modelling. The introduction of RPA can address 
                  these issues, offering a more effective and precise method 
                   for managing financial risks .</li>

                <li>Maintenance and repair- Maintenance is the process  
                that preserves or restores a desired state of a system or 
                facility. It involves three major  activities: Inspection, 
                planned maintenance and disturbance handling.</li>

        <p>Humanoid robots are advanced machines designed to resemble and mimic human 
            movement and behavior. They can walk, speak, and interact in natural ways, 
            making them ideal for assisting in healthcare, education, customer service, 
            and research. Their human-like form allows them to operate tools, navigate 
            environments, and collaborate safely with people.</p>
