            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random 
                text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature 
                from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
                a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked 
                up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem 
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from 
                sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                 (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                 This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during 
                 the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                  amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
                below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de 
                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their 
                exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
                translation by H. Rackham.</p>

        <h1>A bit of History</h1>
        <div>
            
            <p>The dream to create machines that are skilled and intelligent has 
                been part of humanity from the beginning of time. The dream is now 
                becoming part of our world's striking reality. The legend of the 
                Titan Prometheus who moulded the giant Talus , the bronze slave  
                forged by Hephaestus, testify to this quest in Greek mythology. 
                Just as giant Talus was entrusted to protect the island of Crete
                 the industrial age, a mechanical creature is entrusted with
                the task of substituting a human being in labor duties. This 
                concept was introduced by the Czech playwright Karel Capek in 
                1921 in his play Rassum’s Universal Robots. Where he coined 
                the word robot from robota which means forced laborer. 
                While the concept was born in friction, the practical 
                definition of robots varies whereby according to Karel Capek, a 
                robot was a machine similar to a human being, according to the 
                Oxford English dictionary, it is a machine capable of carrying out 
                a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable 
                by computer . Also the International Organisation of standardisation
                 describes it as an automatically controlled programmable in 3 or more 
                 axes either fixed or mobile for use in industrial automation. In addition, 
                 the robot institute of america defines it as reprogrammable multifunctional 
                 manipulator designed to move materials, tools, and specialized devices through 
                 variable programmable motions for performance of a variety of tasks

                This field is termed as robotics , a term coined by a visionary science fiction 
                author Isaac Asimov in 1942. Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering 
                and technology that produces machines that replace human actions. Robotics is based 
                on three fundamental laws:
                A robot may not injure a human being or allow human beings to come to harm
                A robot must obey the orders given by human beings, except when such orders would conflict 
                with the first law
                A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with 
                the first and second law.
                These laws established rules of behavior to consider as specifications for the design of a robot.  
                The modern robots are built on fundamental subjects such as Physics, Mathematics, Computer science 
                and often guided by the principles of 3Hz which are Head- for sensing and decision making, Hand for 
                manipulating with objective and Heart for power source or control.

                Real world evolution took off in the mid 20th century. The following timeline highlights key milestones 
                from the first industrial robot to the intelligent machine today. From its conceptual origins in a play to 
                its current role as the cornerstone of modern technology, the history of robotics is a journey from forced 
                laborer to the intelligent partner and continues to reshape the world.

        <h1>Applications Of Robotics and Automation</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>   
                <li>Automation and Robotics in construction - 
                Building and construction is one of the major  industries  
                around the world. Applications and the activities of robotics
                 and automation in this industry started in the early 90s 
                 aiming to optimize equipment operations, improve safety, 
                 enhance perception of workspace  and ensure a quality
                  environment for building occupants.</li>

                <li>Agricultural industries- Automation and robotics are applied 
                in the various stages of the agriculture industries like 
                irrigation of horticulture land, parks, gardens and golf 
                courses efficiently and reducing  the wastage  of water . 
                Food safety by the selection of appropriate chemicals. 
                Smart farming also helps to maintain the humidity, 
                temperature and irrigation process by using the sensors 
                and apps.</li>

                <li>Quantitative risk assessment in financial institutions- 
                The integration of robotic process automation in quantitative
                 risk assessment signifies a substantial advancement  in  
                 financial  risk management . Traditional approaches  
                 frequently had difficulty in handling the vast volume and 
                 complexibility  of financial data which can lead to 
                 inefficiencies  and potential  inaccuracies in risk
                  assessment modelling. The introduction of RPA can address 
                  these issues, offering a more effective and precise method 
                   for managing financial risks .</li>

                <li>Maintenance and repair- Maintenance is the process  
                that preserves or restores a desired state of a system or 
                facility. It involves three major  activities: Inspection, 
                planned maintenance and disturbance handling.</li>

        <p>Humanoid robots are advanced machines designed to resemble and mimic human 
            movement and behavior. They can walk, speak, and interact in natural ways, 
            making them ideal for assisting in healthcare, education, customer service, 
            and research. Their human-like form allows them to operate tools, navigate 
            environments, and collaborate safely with people.</p>
